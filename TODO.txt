-Fix stack size acceptance in the upgrade gui (replace the hold guis with the new inv wrapper, redo upgrades system), PARTIALLY DONE (clicking a stack for merge isn't stable)
-Try to accelerate the change of the size of the rooms (for now, limit the max size of the rooms), and fix lightning issues (it is possible that the lightnin issue is vanilla and not fixable)
-Implement the tunnel block, rework the application of upgrades to take into account the room they are applied to (the bag is a reference to the main room)
-Implement a random teleport of nearby enemy/whitelisted entity if the filter upgrade isn't applied (for the bag entity, not the item entity)
-Work on craft (very high chance that most craft will be vanilla json files)
-working on IO rights for the bag content itself, not only the player inventory
-fix interaction if the player as an item in hand while targeting the eye/bag
-upgrade: sprinkler: use water to prevent burning, solidify lava, damage "fire" mobs, water farmland
-upgrade: slot upgrade. not only you upgrade the bag volume by row/column but also by slot (because at the start the upgrades are weak and the more row/column you use, the more slots they add, which is unfair for the first upgrades)

-common buttons: applicable to all gui, allow switching of guis
-new blocks for the dimension
-crafts
-Actions gui (facultative? will probably not be done after a while)

-redo crafts: use most vanilla crafting tables, no longer use an upgrade UI
example:
-use the stone cutter to create slots
-apply upgrades using the smithing table

-lightning upgrade: consume rf to generate lightning
-guardian upgrade: consume rf to shoot guardian laser to entities close to the holder and to the eye (always exclude owner, white list by mob type and player name)
-projectile absorber: consume rf to catch projectiles that aren't sent by the holder or owner (white list allowed projectiles to go through)
-boost upgrade: repurpose the firework part of the elytra upgrade, if elytra is equiped, easy elytra + firework. If no elytra and in water/rain, do a trident spin attack. If no elytra and no water, temporary speed + jump boost + fall absorbtion
-armor stand upgrade: repurpose the elytra part of the elytra upgrade and application of armor: add 2 slots to the bag that store a chest plate and an elytra

-see how enchantments work to make some enchantments compatible with the armor stand upgrade
-see how entities/the player interact with the world to create the functions of the ghost hand (for player, might have to simulate key presses, for entities, might have to inject AI goals)
