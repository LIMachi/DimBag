-Work on craft (very high chance that most craft will be vanilla json files)
-upgrade: sprinkler: use water to prevent burning, solidify lava, damage "fire" mobs, water farmland

-common buttons: applicable to all gui, allow switching of guis
-new blocks for the dimension
-crafts
-Actions gui (facultative? will probably not be done after a while)

-guardian upgrade: consume rf to shoot guardian laser to entities close to the holder and to the eye (always exclude owner, white list by mob type and player name)
-projectile absorber: consume rf to catch projectiles that aren't sent by the holder or owner (white list allowed projectiles to go through)
-boost upgrade: repurpose the firework part of the elytra upgrade, if elytra is equiped, easy elytra + firework. If no elytra and in water/rain, do a trident spin attack. If no elytra and no water, temporary speed + jump boost + fall absorbtion

-see how entities/the player interact with the world to create the functions of the ghost hand (for player, might have to simulate key presses, for entities, might have to inject AI goals)

-pillars can be upgraded to player pillar (access to a single slot of the player inventory)
-pillars can be upgraded (like barrels/drawers) to contain more items
-player pillars can be automated using redstone (redstone power on 1 axis select the line/belt/armor/extra inventory, redstont on the other axis selects the column)

-similar to crystals and pillars, ponds store fluids inside the bag, which one is used for input is random, which one is used for output is selectable from the bag (or we could do the last one that received a redstone signal)

-we could add a mode linked to a redstone block (adding the block inside the bag unlocks the mode) which allow the bag user to send redstone signals selecting the mode and on right clic open a radial menu to change the redtone signal (0-15, 16 radials? might be a little much)

-finish those goddamned models and guis (please, for the love of god, finish the settings/widget system)
-btw: you might have to rethink the guis entirely, swallow up your pride and go back to the standard way of doing it (one screen for one container) (you can keep the good parts tho and make SimpleContainer and SimpleContainerScreen into abstract BaseContainer and abstract BaseScreen)

-block to move the bag (use redstone on the cardinals to move, might be able to move the holding entity, should prevent the bag from falling)

(only when all else is finished, get back on track you dofus)
->proto pearl branch:
proto pearl (when consumed/eaten) will have a random effect in the following list:
+change your size (half or double for 1 minute, potion effect)
+throw a standard enderpearl
+summon an ender mite

->size pearl branch:
size pearl (stabilized proto pearl in size mode) will change your size when consumed
-halve your size if you are sneaking (limited to 2 times or 1/2 of a block height)
-double your size if you are standing (limited to 2 times or 8 blocks height)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO ADDITION EDITION:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
add documentation (book/tooltips/UI text) (might look into Patchouli)
add back the 'player pillar' features
finish the WII block (fluids)
almost finished --- add a new block placeable outside the bag to access the bag as a block (proxy) (allowing interactions with the inventory, tanks and batteries of the bag. note: interaction is passive, needs modded conduits/hoppers to work) (low tier: need the bag inside the block, high tier: bound to a bag)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO DEBUG EDITION:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
finish those god-damn UI
finish modeling/texturing
look into sync bag and TE config in better ways (and maybe test for hacks/invalid values' server side)
use 'Flight Recorder' and 'Coverage' to test how much the mod impact the performances of the game (RIP bag gateway renderers, too heavy)
test against other mods/throw in a modpack
test/balance upgrades and crafts (early, mid, late game, again the best way is playing on a modpack)
prevent or un-equip bag when using another mod to teleport a player inside a bag (waystone, I'm looking at you)
